Critical edition of 16th century Hungarian treatise 'Embernek három fő ellensége vagyon' encoded in TEI XML with Oxygen XML Editor. The spelling is modernized and two variants are given: the Codex Bod from the first quarter of the 16th century (Budapest, EK, Cod. Hung. 7) and the Codex Lobkowicz from 1514 (Prague, Property of the Lobkowicz family, VI. Fg. 30).

The first version was created during the SCUSI Summer School in April 2019.
